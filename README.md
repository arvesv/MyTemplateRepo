# MyTemplateRepo
My set of common files that I usually put in a new GitHub/Visual Studio repository. Feel free to use, but check the values in these files 


[global.json][def] - Specifices the version of the .NET sdk used. Used by the dotnet cli tools as well ass the GitHub action actions/setup-dotnet@v4

[.editorconfig][def2] - Some commom settings for tab/spaces etc supported by some editors (Visual Studio Code requres a plugin
)
[def]: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/global-json
[def2]: https://editorconfig.org/

.gitignore - Duh ..  Every git repo needs one
.gitattributes -  Standadize end
